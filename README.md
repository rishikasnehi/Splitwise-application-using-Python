# Splitwise Application Using Python

A simple command-line tool to help groups split expenses, track balances, and simplify repayments—just like the Splitwise app but built using Python.

## 🚀 Why This Project Is Useful

- **Tracks Balances:** Displays outstanding balances, letting everyone know if they owe or get back money.
- **Debt Simplification:** Calculates simplified repayments so fewer transactions are needed to settle up.
- **Easy to Use:** Interactive prompts guide users through adding members, recording expenses, and viewing balances.
